# MCBedrockQuery
 Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Query for servers written in Java
# What is this?
With this you're able to query with usage of java, to query a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Server. You can retrieve shared information of the destination server.
# This already exists.
Indeed it does. In Java, specially for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition servers this doesn't. Also this wasn't done on android so far yet, without usage of any online API.
